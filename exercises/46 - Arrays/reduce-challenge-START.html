    I have collected ten great repositories you can find on GitHub that will definitely give you an instant knowledge boost.
    
    1. Awesome
    Awesome is, without a doubt, the most popular repo that curates all topics from software development to hardware to business. It has more than 123,000 stars on Github at this moment, and one could spend days (nights) browsing it. It is my one-stop-shop if I want to learn something new.

    2. List of (Advanced) JavaScript Questions
    This repository (13,000 stars) created by Lydia Hallie (great person, by the way, check her out on Instagram!) is awesome if you want to test your JavaScript knowledge and/or prepare for a job interview. Lydia constantly adds new questions, so this repo is growing steadily!

    3. JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
    JavaScript Algorithms (59,500 stars) contains a tremendous amount of JavaScript-based examples of popular and less popular algorithms and data structures. The structure is really nice because the examples are labeled either beginner or advanced. So whether you are interested in cryptography, sorting, graphs or even machine learning (and much more), there will be something for you.

    4. Clean Code JavaScript
    Knowing how to write clean code is a useful skill for almost every developer and mandatory in many projects and corporations. This repository (28,400 Stars) takes the concepts of Clean Code by Robert C. Martin and adapts them for JavaScript so you can use them in future work.
    
    
    
    
    Link to Repo
    
    5. free-for.dev
    This great repository (30,000 stars) was created to helping developers find software (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS) and similar offerings that have free tiers. Using great software for free? Sounds awesome! There are services for email, CI/CD, monitoring, DNS, hosting, and many, many more.

    6. Tech Interview Handbook
    If you want to prepare yourself for a job interview in tech (and you should!), this repository is just the right place for you. It currently has 38,000 stars on Github and helps you with:
    
    How to prepare for coding interviews
    Interview cheatsheet
    Algorithm tips/best practice questions
    Interview formats
    ‚Ä¶and more
    Check it out before heading to the next interview.

    7. Effective Engineer ‚Äî Notes
    An ‚ÄúEffective Engineer‚Äù is someone who gets things done. But how can you become one? This Github repository (3,700 stars) has advice for you! Topics include:
    
    How to optimize your learning
    How to prioritize
    Measuring your improvement
    
    
    
    Link to Repo
    
    8. List of Free Learning Resources
    This repository has a whopping 135,000 stars on Github and definitely is one of the most-loved curations there. It offers lots and lots of freely available programming books, screencasts, podcasts, and even online courses of all sorts. If you are looking for learning materials ‚Äî look no further!

    9. Big List of Naughty Strings
    You can invest as much as you want into testing your code and programs, but when real users come into play ‚Äî believe me, they will do things you would have never thought of, especially when it comes to user input. This repository (34,100 stars) has a huge list of Strings that are known to be problematic when entered as input by the user. So whether you want to impress your QA friends or uses this for testing your software, this could be quite useful!

    10. Awesome First PR Opportunities
    The last repository I want to recommend to you is great if you want to get started with Open Source. Contributing to OSS is a great way to get involved with the community, add something to your portfolio, try out new things, become a better developer, and even find a new job. But getting started is quite hard, as I know from personal experience. This repository lists Open Source projects that are known for or currently have beginner-friendly issues that you can tackle. It helped me getting started with OSS, should help you as well!

    I hope you find these repositories as awesome as I do, and I really hope that some of them will help you on your journey as a web developer.
